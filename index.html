        </div>  
        <p>I'm a recent second-generation graduate from the University of Wisconsin- Lacrosse that attained a bachelors degree in Psychology. My initial plan was to be an Occupational Therapist after later completing graduate school at the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee. But after some events transpired, I decided to expand my capabilities and get in the coding game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My hobbies include gaming, weight training, basketball, and hanging out with friends and family. Gaming has been a prominent thing in my life for the longest time. For as long as I can remember I've been playing videos, especially super smash bros; which I'd argue I'm the greatest at. As for basketball, I wouldn't make the same declaration. Playing pick-up here-and-there is just enough to do it for me. Spending time with friends and family is what really tops the cake though. Nothing like doing all sorts of activities together that can make me feel more than great!</p>
