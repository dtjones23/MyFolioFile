# MyFolioFile

# Description
The purpose of this project was to develop a professional portfolio. This will allow me to showcase all of my work to potential future employers. Displaying live web applications are said to increase chances of selection with those employers. Having a high-quality portfolio will not only show the multiple projects, but will also grant the viewers a spec of my creativity. This project's objective is that I prove my capabilities to all who view my page.
